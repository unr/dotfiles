**Personal OSX setup guide for frontend development with vue &amp;&amp; vim.** This is a more manual guide on h
ow I set up a fresh computer. Less of a guide on how to use an automated process to get it done.




## Basic Installs

*These are the immediate defaults, things that aren't automated.*

### Logins

1. Login to Chrome, sync my passwords/accounts

2. Install 1Password, sync my passwords





### TODO

- [ ] Mac OSX Defaults setup, preferably [in a script](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) to run? (dock, key repeat, mouse settings, etc)
- [ ] Brew install / requirements
- [ ] Vs Code setup / configs 
- [ ] guide on what/how to symlink dotfiles to places (git settings, global configs zsh, valet)
